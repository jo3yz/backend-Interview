为什么要有字节对齐？

Such alignment restrictions simplify the design of the hardware forming the interface between the processor and the memory system.
For example, suppose a processor always fetches 8 bytes from memory with an address that must be a multiple of 8. If we can guarantee that any double will be aligned to have its address be a multiple of 8, then the value can be read or written with a single memory operation. Otherwise, we may need to perform two memory accesses, since the object might be split across two 8-byte memory blocks.
On the other hand, some of the SSE instructions for implementing multimedia operations will not work correctly with unaligned data.

怎么控制字节对齐？

基于字节对齐的存在，不能用memcmp比较两个结构体是否相等，因为对齐填充区域的值是随机的。
